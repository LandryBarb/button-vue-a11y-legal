# 🎬  Vue 3 Entertainment Accessibility Component Suite  


## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains hands-on learning work guided by three coordinated expert tutors:

1. **Vue 3 Technical Tutor** – Teaches Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Pinia, Router, Vitest, Cypress, and atomic design.  
2. **Accessibility-in-Vue Tutor** – Ensures each component is accessible using semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard support, and screen reader patterns.  
3. **WCAG 2.2 AAA + ADA Compliance Tutor** – Ensures legal-level compliance, documentation, audits, and certification readiness.

All lessons, components, and commits build toward a **production-grade entertainment-industry Vue application** and a **fully accessible component library**.
